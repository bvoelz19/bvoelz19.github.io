### About me
I'm a Computer Science student at Tufts University with interests in software engineering and web development. I have prior software engineering internship experience at Staples, where I built a full stack web application to support supply chain operations. Additionally, I am currently a teaching assistant for Professor Ming Chow's [Web Programming course](https://tuftsdev.github.io/WebProgramming), and I have participated and placed 2nd in the [2016 International Development Hackathon](https://devpost.com/software/worldbankcurb).

At the moment, I am currently seeking internship opportunities in software engineering and web development for Summer 2018. You can [view my resume here](https://bvoelz19.github.io/resume.pdf) to get my contact information and to get a better sense of my background.
