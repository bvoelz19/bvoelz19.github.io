	I have begun to learn about the acceptable practices when writing HTML and
	CSS files for websites.

Correctly Implemented:
	To my knowledge, all modules of this assignment have been implemented
	according to the assignment's specifications.

Collaboration:
	I consulted StackOverflow for assistance in styling elements to look like
	buttons for my navigation bar. I also read the Piazza posts to stay up
	to date on findings my classmates were sharing.

Hours Spent:
	~10 hours
